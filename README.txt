Hey Hope!!

This is a quick guide to my little software dohickey. You can completely ignore any files that end in .py. Those are the things that I coded. What is nice about this solution is that you do not have to download anything, and I can also edit/update the program remotely! Bug fixes and new features should be easy.

Step 1:
Open the Cision Files folder on the left side of the screen under the Files tab. Either create a new folder, or add the downloaded Cision file into the appriate folder (e.g. Minnesota Grown). Do this by selecting the three dots just to the right of the Files tab and select "Upload File". You may have to drag it into the correct folder within the Files tab.

Step 2:
Hit the big green Run button at the top of your screen. Now the program will start.

Step 3:
Next open FormattingCheatSheet.txt. This is open in the center of your screen. It may be useful to drag FormattingCheatSheet.txt from the center window to the upper right window, so you can have both files visible at the same time. (Do this by grabbing the header and dragging and dropping)

Step 4:
The bottom right of the screen is your Console. This is where the magic happens. Click anywhere in this window before typing in a command (the box should be solid, not hollow). 

Step 5: 
The first prompt asks for the input folder. This is the subfolder that you made in the Cision Files Folder in the files tab. For example, you can type "Minnesota Grown", then enter. This will look at all the files within the Minnesota Grown Folder. (Be very careful about spelling and capitalization) Note, right now I only have it set to work when there is a single file in each subfolder, so you will have to remove Cision files once you are done. 

Step 6: 
This is now the formatting input menu. The current format is displayed at the top (intially empty). Using the FormattingCheatSheet.txt as a reference, type in the format of each column that you want in order (e.g. type "D" then enter for Date). There is a "Delete Previous" option!!

Step 7:
Repeat Step 6 until you have all the formatting you want. The left column in FormattingCheatSheet.txt must be the column heading as read from the Cision file, or else my program will not be able to find the column, so those cannot change. However, if you for any reason want to change any of the shortcuts, feel free! Change any of them to whatever best suits you. After any changes though, you will have to rerun the program, by hitting Stop and then running it again.

Step 8:
Last Step!! Finally type in whatever you want to call the output file and hit enter! The file will be made and put into the Formatted Files. Find it, and click the three dots to find its Download option.
